# Draw-myself-with-CSS

CSS art is a difficult yet rewarding CSS activity. It requires you to have an incredibly strong understanding 
of CSS in order to create good looking CSS art which is why it is a perfect tool for practicing CSS. In this project,
I created an image of myself using CSS.

After this, you will have a better understanding of the following concepts:
1. CSS Specificity 
2. Border Box
3. Pseudo Element

I had a tons of fun in building this.Hope you enjoy it too!
