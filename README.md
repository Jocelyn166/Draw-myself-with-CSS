# Draw-myself-with-CSS

## Description

CSS art is a challenging yet rewarding activity that requires a strong understanding of CSS to create visually appealing art. This makes it an excellent tool for practicing CSS. In this project, I created an image of myself entirely using CSS.

## Built With

1. **CSS Specificity**: Understanding and utilizing the specificity of CSS selectors to style elements accurately.
2. **Border Box**: Making use of the `box-sizing: border-box;` property to manage element dimensions more predictably.
3. **Pseudo Elements**: Using pseudo-elements like `::before` and `::after` for decorative purposes without adding extra elements to the HTML.

I had tons of fun building this. Hope you enjoy it too!
